### Visual story telling part 1: green buildings

### Question: 
Do you agree with the conclusions of her on-staff stats guru? If so, point to evidence supporting his case. If not, explain specifically where and why the analysis goes wrong, and how it can be improved. Do you see the possibility of confounding variables for the relationship between rent and green status? If so, provide evidence for confounding, and see if you can also make a picture that visually shows how we might "adjust" for such a confounder. Tell your story in pictures, with appropriate introductory and supporting text.

### Solution:
Yes, I created a few charts in order to understand and verify the conclusions from stats guru:
1. Low occupany rates:

From the above two charts, we can clearly see that there is skewness in the data and majority of the data points indicates more than 50% occupancy. Hence, removing low occupancy rates is a reasonable decision.






Confounding Variables:

### Green Rating vs. Rent:

Leasing Rate vs Rent:

Stories vs. Rent: Another box plot can be generated to compare the distribution of rents for different quality classes (Class A, B, and C) for both green and non-green buildings.


Amenities vs. Rent: A similar box plot can be created to compare the distribution of rents based on the presence of amenities in both types of buildings.


These visualizations will help the developer and decision-makers better understand the potential confounding factors that might affect the relationship between green status and rent.

Conclusion:

From the preliminary analysis as well as the above visuals we can suggests that building a green building could be financially viable. Some of the confo
