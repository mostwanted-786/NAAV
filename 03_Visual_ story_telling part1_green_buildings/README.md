### Visual story telling part 1: green buildings

### Question: 
Do you agree with the conclusions of her on-staff stats guru? If so, point to evidence supporting his case. If not, explain specifically where and why the analysis goes wrong, and how it can be improved. Do you see the possibility of confounding variables for the relationship between rent and green status? If so, provide evidence for confounding, and see if you can also make a picture that visually shows how we might "adjust" for such a confounder. Tell your story in pictures, with appropriate introductory and supporting text.

### Solution:
In order to understand and verify the conclusions drawn by the Excel guru, I created several charts to explore various aspects:

### Low Occupancy Rates:

The above two charts reveal a skewness in the data, with the majority of data points indicating over 50% occupancy. Consequently, the decision to remove low occupancy rates appears reasonable.

### Agreement with Excel Guru's Conclusion:
While I concur with the Excel guru's conclusion, the calculations indicate that profits from a green building are expected after 8.5 years. Given that the average building age is approximately 47 years, the investment in a green building is evidently profitable over the long term.


### Additional Factors to Consider:
In order to make a well-informed decision, it is essential to consider other influencing factors. I explored these aspects with the following visualizations:

### Green Rating vs. Rent:

The median rent is higher for buildings with a Green Rating of 1, indicating a potential positive impact on rent from having green certification (+0.18$)


### Leasing Rate vs Rent:

As expected, there is a correlation between higher leasing rates or occupancy and increased rent

### Stories vs. Rent:

Lower floor or stories tend to command higher rents compared to higher floor buildings

### Amenities vs. Rent: 
![newplot-8](https://github.com/mostwanted-786/NAAV/assets/139088219/4d2d8d9d-4f0c-4a1b-acf6-ec4e14b48ac7)

Interestingly, the presence of amenities does not appear to significantly impact higher rents.

### Quality(class a,b) vs. Rent: 
![newplot-13](https://github.com/mostwanted-786/NAAV/assets/139088219/9a8b2149-f4e0-4663-9521-4317742f1c52)

![newplot-14](https://github.com/mostwanted-786/NAAV/assets/139088219/a77cd59e-67b2-49dc-a759-b9b3d0ead921)

The quality classes (Class A and B) also do not seem to play a significant role in obtaining higher rents for green buildings

These visualizations help us understand how the the developer can make a better decision in order to to understand the potential confounding factors that might affect the relationship between green status and rent.

### Conclusion: Adjusting for Confounds
Taking into account the preliminary analysis and the insights gained from the visualizations, it is reasonable to consider building a green building as financially viable. However, to maximize the benefits, attention must be given to potential confounding factors. Constructing buildings with lower floors, a focus on occupancy rates, and less emphasis on amenities could lead to better rent outcomes.
